# Tetuan City power consumption
Predicting electricity power consumption in Tetuan city

Tetouan is a city located in the north of Morocco which occupies an area of around 10375 kmÂ² and its population is about 550.374 inhabitants, according to the last Census of 2014, and is increasing rapidly, approximately 1.96% annually. Since it is located along the Mediterranean Sea, its weather is mild and rainy in the winter, hot and dry during the summer months.

Source of the Dataset:

The power consumption data was collected from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) of Amendis which is a public service operator and in charge of the distribution of drinking water and electricity since 2002. The purpose of the electricity distribution network is to serve low and medium voltage consumers in Tetouan regions. For this purpose, the delivery and distribution of electrical energy from the point of delivery to the end user, the customer, is ensured by Amendis. The energy which is distributed comes from the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water. After transforming the high voltage (63 kV) to medium voltage (20 kV), it is allowed to transport and distribute the energy. The distribution network is powered by 3 source stations, namely: Quads, Smir and Boussafou.

We will try to investigate the dataset and try to answer these questions:
        - .......
One of the questions treated in this project is how to know the energy produced and consumed in order to balance production and consumption, to decrease the cost of production, and to control future planning?
